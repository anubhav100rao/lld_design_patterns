# LLD Design Patterns in Go

This repository demonstrates various Low-Level Design (LLD) patterns implemented in Go, with a focus on practical, real-world examples. Each pattern is organized in its own directory and includes sample code to illustrate its usage.

## Patterns Included

-   **Abstract Factory**: Cross-database driver example for creating connections, query builders, and migration runners for different databases.
-   **Builder**: HTTP and SQL builder patterns for constructing complex objects step by step.
-   **Constructor**: Examples of cache, DB client, and HTTP server construction.
-   **Factory**: Factory pattern for database, logger, notification, and payment processor creation.
-   **Prototype**: ETL job and HTTP client prototype implementations.
-   **Singleton**: Singleton pattern for DB connection, HTTP client, and S3 connector.

## Project Structure

```
abstract_factory/      # Abstract Factory pattern
builder/               # Builder pattern
constructor/           # Constructor pattern
factory/               # Factory pattern
prototype/             # Prototype pattern
singleton/             # Singleton pattern
main.go                # Entry point (if applicable)
go.mod, go.sum         # Go module files
```

## How to Run

1. **Clone the repository:**

    ```sh
    git clone <repo-url>
    cd lld_design_patterns
    ```

2. **Install dependencies:**

    ```sh
    go mod tidy
    ```

3. **Run a demo:**
   Each pattern can be run individually. For example, to run the Abstract Factory demo:
    ```sh
    go run main.go
    ```
    Or run a specific file:
    ```sh
    go run abstract_factory/cross_database_driver.go
    ```

## Requirements

-   Go 1.18 or higher
